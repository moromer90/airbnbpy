# airbnbpy

Python library for querying **AirBnb** data.

While the original idea for this project was to create a simple client to query the **unofficial AirBnb API**, it also exposes a request builder that returns how to query it so it can be used with **Scrapy** too.

It is needed to extract a `client_id` key from a device that can query such API, as the official Android app.

*Client not yet implemented*.
